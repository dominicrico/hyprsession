# HyprSession

HyprSession is a utility designed to store and restore window sessions for Hyprland, a dynamic tiling window manager for Linux. Initially created using [Bun.js](https://bun.sh), the tool is compiled into a binary for seamless usage on Linux systems.

> [!NOTE]
> Most of it should work and depending on the window count it will take a while.
> This is through the nature of hyprland. 
> Also please note applications like chromium (if you use multiple windows) 
> or vesktop/vencord (if you need to login) will not be restored correctly.
> This will hopefully work in a future release.
